Project Summary Report: HMC Redesign
Accomplishments and Reflections
What I’m Most Proud Of
Enhanced Functionality: Successfully integrating dynamic features like the “Learn More” modal for yachts, which provides detailed information in an interactive, user-friendly way.
Responsive Design: Ensuring the site is mobile-friendly with responsive layouts for all sections, including the gallery and modal functionality.
Styling and Customization: Leveraging SCSS for a cohesive design with custom variables, mixins, and responsive adjustments, while maintaining the brand's identity.
What Could Have Been Improved
Content Strategy: With more time, I would improve the quality and variety of content, ensuring a more extensive gallery and richer descriptions for each product.
Accessibility: While ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation are included, additional testing and refinement could enhance the site’s accessibility.
Testing and Optimization: Comprehensive testing across multiple browsers and devices to identify and resolve minor inconsistencies in layout or behavior.
Changes Made in Response to Feedback
Feedback from Critiques and Instructor
Critique 1: Improve Modal Design

Feedback: The modals needed to include additional information and better styling.
Response: Updated modals to include yacht details like Model and Type and improved the modal's layout with enhanced typography and spacing.
Critique 2: Responsive Design

Feedback: Some elements, like the navigation and gallery images, weren’t scaling well on smaller screens.
Response: Optimized the navigation bar for mobile devices and adjusted the gallery layout using CSS Grid and SCSS media queries.
Critique 3: User Feedback for Forms

Feedback: The contact form didn’t provide clear feedback for validation errors or success messages.
Response: Added real-time validation for form fields and an alert for successful submissions that automatically disappears after 4 seconds.
Instructor Feedback: Design Consistency

Feedback: Ensure all sections, like the hero, footer, and cards, maintain a consistent design language.
Response: Unified typography, spacing, and color schemes across all components using SCSS variables and mixins.
Resources and Assets
Frameworks and Libraries
React: Used for building the project’s structure and implementing reusable components.
React Router: Enabled smooth navigation between pages.
Bootstrap: Provided foundational grid and utility classes.
SCSS: Used for styling, customization, and maintaining a modular codebase.
Font Awesome: Added icons to improve visual appeal in sections like the footer.
Google Fonts: Incorporated Lato and Ridley Grotesk for typography.
Code Snippets and Plugins
Modal Logic: Custom logic for managing the state of dynamic modals.
Validation Code: Built using examples from form validation patterns, adapting them to React.
Responsive Design: Leveraged SCSS mixins and Bootstrap utilities for responsiveness.
Key Design Decisions and Justifications
Color Palette:
The muted blues and grays, combined with the highlight green, reinforce a professional, high-end marine aesthetic.
Typography:
Using Ridley Grotesk for headers and Lato for body text maintains clarity and elegance.
Navigation:
A combination of a sticky navbar and an overlay for small screens ensures intuitive navigation across devices.
Modals:
Implemented to avoid page reloads and maintain user engagement by displaying additional information interactively.
Customizations to Framework Design
SCSS Variables and Mixins: Replaced default Bootstrap variables with custom colors and fonts.
Unique Card Designs: Customized Bootstrap card styles with shadows, rounded corners, and hover effects.
Hero Section Overlay: Integrated a custom-designed overlay for a modern, clean introduction.
Advanced Features Incorporated
Dynamic Modals: Interactive modals for displaying additional yacht details.
Real-Time Form Validation: Displays validation errors dynamically and clears them when the user starts typing.
Success Alerts: Custom success messages that disappear after a set timeout.
Image Gallery Zoom: A clickable gallery that expands images in a centered, full-screen view.
Challenges and Problem-Solving
State Management in Modals:

Challenge: Preventing background interactions when modals were open.
Solution: Used document.body.style.overflow to disable background scrolling.
Responsive Adjustments:

Challenge: Ensuring consistent design across devices, especially with complex layouts like the gallery.
Solution: Utilized SCSS media queries and CSS Grid for flexible layouts.
Dynamic Error Handling:

Challenge: Managing form validation states dynamically without confusing the user.
Solution: Implemented real-time error clearing and success feedback.
Conclusion
This project provided an excellent opportunity to merge React's dynamic capabilities with SCSS's power for styling. The result is a professional, feature-rich site that balances aesthetics, functionality, and performance. With additional refinements in content and accessibility, this project has the potential to become a portfolio highlight.
